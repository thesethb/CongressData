# CongressData
This code was used by me to make a dataset comparing congressional partisanship/voting behavior to electoral performance.

ParseScript is the first part of the programs, which takes a list of all votes from a congress and returns the average amount of times a member votes with his/her party leader. 

CongressSetup sorts through these congressmembers, picking out only those who go on to run in a competitive reelection and matches them with their election results.

DistrictLean, matches the partisan lean of a district with the candidate who is running in it using presidential election results.
